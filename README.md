Welcome to my ruby games solutions!
Here you can find three solutions to tasks but some of them
You can test yourself and some of them with specs.

You should have ruby on your computer 

copies.rb and presents.rb you can try in your terminal runing :

$ ruby copies.rb 

and write three integer values x (time of 1st xerox), y (time of 2nd xerox), n (copies count)

$ ruby presents.rb

and write four integer values x, y, z (components weigth), w (max weigth)

others you can try with running specs :

$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rspec
